## What is a lecture summary?

A lecture summary is a quick, organized way to capture the most important points from a lecture. It’s designed to help you and your peers review big ideas, key terms, and examples for exams and future projects. Each lecture may have one or several modules. For a single-module lecture, your group will write one summary; for multiple modules, you’ll write one summary per module. Since lectures are about the same length, each group will handle a similar amount of content.

### How It Works
This year, we will uss this assignment to explores the intersection of human expertise and AI capabilities in academic content synthesis. Throughout the semester, students will collaboratively create and evaluate lecture summaries through a two-stage process. 

Task 1 involves creating original lecture summaries from course materials, with specific requirements tailored to each module's content.

Task 2 involves evaluating summaries produced by Task 1 students alongside AI-generated alternatives, then synthesizing the best elements into a refined final summary.

This structured approach allows us to examine how human-generated and AI-generated academic content compare in accuracy, clarity, and pedagogical value.

### Participation
Each student will be assigned once during the semester. Additional volunteer opportunities may arise to fill scheduling gaps, offering extra credit for those interested in deeper engagement with the material.

### Submission Guidelines
You will see your assigned module and task in the shared-with-student gsheet, and you will receive related material and information from TF a week before the lecuture.
