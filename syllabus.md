Please see [last year's syllabus](http://cbb752b22.gersteinlab.org/syllabus) (with slide packs & videos at the bottom) for previews for this yearâ€™s lectures, which will be slightly different. For this year, an updated slide pack will be posted after the lecture. (If it is substantially different from '21, an updated video will also be posted.)
