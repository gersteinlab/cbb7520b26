Addendum for final Project:

* All analysis will be on Chr 18 

* For part 1, in doing mutational burden, first do the simplest approach (raw counts). There will be extra credit for suggesting and implementing how this simple approach can be modified. 

* Extra credit will be given if you do 2 (but not more) of the subparts in part 2 of the analysis. You may use either the gene list from the simplest approach (raw counts) or your own modified approach, if you have one.

* For the shared presentation file, please make sure this is in powerpoint. 

* **New Due Date** May 8th (Sunday) 2021, 11:59 PM EST. Submission in Canvas.
